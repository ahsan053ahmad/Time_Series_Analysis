# Time_Series_Analysis

This repository contains a **Time Series Analysis assignment focused on Tesla (TSLA) stock prices**, completed as part of a Machine Learning / Statistical Modeling course. The project applies classical time series techniques to explore trends, stationarity, and forecasting behavior in financial data. The analysis is documented using a reproducible R Markdown workflow and rendered as an HTML report.

## Business Problem

Financial time series data often exhibit trends, volatility, and temporal dependencies that must be properly understood before reliable forecasting can be performed. The goal of this assignment was to analyze Tesla’s historical stock prices and apply statistical time series models to identify patterns and evaluate predictive performance.

## Project Objectives

The objectives of this project were to:

- Perform exploratory time series analysis on Tesla stock price data  
- Identify trends, seasonality, and volatility patterns  
- Test for stationarity and apply appropriate transformations  
- Build and evaluate classical time series models  
- Interpret forecasting results in a financial context

## Solution Approach

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized stock price movements over time  
- Examined distributions and volatility  
- Identified trend components and irregular behavior  

### Stationarity & Diagnostics
- Conducted stationarity tests (e.g., Augmented Dickey-Fuller)  
- Applied differencing and transformations where required  
- Analyzed ACF and PACF plots for model identification  

### Modeling & Forecasting
- Implemented classical models including:
  - Autoregressive (AR)
  - Moving Average (MA)
  - ARIMA
- Selected parameters based on diagnostics and model performance  
- Generated forecasts and evaluated residual behavior  

### Evaluation
- Assessed model fit and forecasting accuracy  
- Checked residuals for randomness and independence  
- Compared models to identify the best-performing approach
